To successfully follow this tutorial, you are required to have access to a GitHub account.

To start, you should fork [this repo](https://github.com/halvtomat/dd2482-is-bad) by pressing "fork" in the top-right corner
and then cloning the repo with the `git clone`{{copy}} command.

You probably have to create an access token for your GitHub account and use it here to be able to clone the repo. If not you should stil do it since you will need it to push later. Find out how to do it [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

Now you should be able to cd into the repo with the following command:

`cd dd2482-is-bad`{{exec}}
