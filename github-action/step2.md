You should now have a `.github/workflows`{{}} directory.

It is time to create your first action.

A new file called `action.yml`{{}} has been created in your `workflows`{{}} directory.

Open vim with `vim action.yml`{{exec}} and copy the following YAML content into the `action.yml`{{}} file:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Demo
on: [push]
jobs:
  Explore-GitHub-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by GitHub!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ github.ref }} and your repository is ${{ github.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ github.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ github.workspace }}
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```{{copy}}

**TIP**: To paste your clipboard into the file in vim, use `CTRL+SHIFT+V`{{}} (or `CMD+SHIFT+V`{{}} on OSX).

**TIP**: You can exit vim by first entering _normal mode_ (press ESC), then typing `:x`{{}}(save and exit) and then pressing enter

Now if you push the changes to your GitHub repo, the action is automatically deployed and will run on all future pushes to the repo.

To push to the repo, use the following commands:

`cd ~/dd2482-is-bad`{{exec}}

`git add ./`{{exec}}

`git commit -m "add action demo"`{{exec}}

`git push`{{exec}}

You should now see your action in action on your GitHub repo!
