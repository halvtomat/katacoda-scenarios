Congratulations on finishing the tutorial!

You should now be able to setup GitHub Actions to automate some tedious dev tasks so that you have more time for the problem solving.

To test all the actions you can fork [this repo](https://github.com/halvtomat/katacoda-github-action-example) which contains everything needed to test out the actions.
